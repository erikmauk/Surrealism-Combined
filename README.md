# Surrealism-Combined
Computational Art: Project 2 (Surrealism Mash-Up)

This is the second project that I have mentioned from a previous lab.

The origins of this combination piece come from my lab on surrealism and that of Ryan Hunter as well. Essentially, we took
the eye from my lab, took off the background, and placed it on his canvas. 

When the user clicks his lemon-blimp, it moves from left to right across the screen and drops seeds as it moves.
A click on the largest and closest sprout on the ground propells it into space.
And, as you might have seen before, a click on the eye's pupil will change the iris.

Within this repository, you will find a demo video of the final product attached. Enjoy!
